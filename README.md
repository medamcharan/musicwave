When sharing a project that uses an **API key**, itâ€™s important to **never expose your actual API key** in public repositories or posts. Instead, you can guide users on how to add their own API key. Here's how you can update your GitHub repository description to include instructions for adding an API key:

### **Project Name:** MusicWave  

### **Description:**  
**MusicWave** is a web-based music player built with **React** and **Vite**, designed to deliver a fast and seamless music experience. Leveraging the **YouTube API**, the app provides access to a vast library of music and videos in **all languages**. Users can search for their favorite tracks, play them instantly, and save them to their **Favorites** list with just one click.  

This project is bootstrapped with **Vite**, offering a modern and efficient development environment with features like **Hot Module Replacement (HMR)** and **fast build times**. The app also uses **Redux** for state management, ensuring a scalable and maintainable codebase.

### **Tech Stack:**  
- **Frontend:** React, Redux, CSS3  
- **Build Tool:** Vite  
- **API Integration:** YouTube Data API v3  
- **Hosting:** Netlify

### **Development Setup:**  
This project uses **Vite** with React for a fast and optimized development experience. Two official Vite plugins are available:  
1. **[@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md):** Uses Babel for Fast Refresh.  
2. **[@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc):** Uses SWC for Fast Refresh.  

To get started:  
1. Clone the repository.  
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash  
   npm install  
   ```  
3. Add your **YouTube API Key:**  
   - Obtain a YouTube Data API v3 key from the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).  
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project.  
   - Add your API key to the `.env` file as follows:  
     ```env  
     VITE_YOUTUBE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here  
     ```  
4. Start the development server:  
   ```bash  
   npm run dev  
   ```  
5. Open the app in your browser at `http://localhost:5173`.

### **Notes:**  
- The YouTube API has a **daily quota limit** (10,000 units per day for the free tier), which may restrict usage if exceeded.  
- This project is a great example of modern web development practices, combining **React**, **Vite**, and **Redux** for a dynamic and scalable music player.  

---

### **Important:**  
- **Do not expose your API key publicly.** Always use environment variables (`.env`) to store sensitive information like API keys.  
- Add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file to ensure it is not pushed to your repository.
